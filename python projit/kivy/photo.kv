    text:'Welcome to ISSUE #135 of The Overflow! This newsletter is by developers, for developers, Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has appointed a new head of the police amid criticism over recent human rights violations by the country's security officers.

Ms Samia on Tuesday appointed Camillus Wambura, the former director of criminal investigations, as the new inspector-general of police.

He replaces Simon Sirro, who has been named Tanzania's ambassador to Zimbabwe.

President Samia also appointed Ramadhan Hamisi Kingai as the new director of criminal investigations.

Upon the reshuffle of the top bosses, President Samia said that her government's priority was to have an efficient force that would observe the rights of the people and their property. There will be a committee to assess police performance, she said.

However, human rights activists describe the changes as "delayed".

The changes come a month after some accused the Tanzanian police of violently evicting Maasai herders from their ancestral land in the northern Ngorongoro district.

At least 30 people were wounded during clashes between protestors and security forces.'
